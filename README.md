# SequelizeBurger
*This is the Sequelize version of my Burger Application*

Sequelize Burger is a website that lets you enter any Burger that you'd like to eat, and then __EAT DAT BURGER__ at the click of a button.

All you need to do is enter the type of Burger that you'd like to enter into the input field on the left, and then use the available buttons to have that Burger Delivered to you. After Delivery, you can send it back, or devour it!

To start devouring, you can take a look at it, at the following link:
